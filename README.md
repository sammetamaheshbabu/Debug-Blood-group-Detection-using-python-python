## Introduction

Blood Group Detection System is a Python application designed to determine the blood group of a person based on images of blood samples reacted with different reagents. The system utilizes image processing techniques to analyze the reactions and infer the blood group accurately.

## Objective

The main objective of the Blood Group Detection System is to automate the process of blood group determination, reducing manual errors and time consumption in traditional methods.

## Features

1. **Image selection**: Allows users to choose images of blood samples for analysis.
2. **Green plane extraction**: Extracts the green plane from the selected images to enhance antigen visibility.
3. **Thresholding techniques**: Utilizes various thresholding methods to segment the antigens from the background.
4. **Morphological operations**: Performs morphological operations to refine the antigen segmentation results.
5. **Histogram analysis**: Analyzes the pixel intensity distribution to further refine the blood group classification.
6. **Quantification**: Provides quantitative analysis of the blood sample to determine the blood group.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes image processing techniques to analyze blood sample images and determine the blood group based on the reactions with different reagents. It consists of various processes such as green plane extraction, thresholding, adaptive thresholding, morphology, histogram analysis, and quantification.

## Working Of The Project

1. Users select images of blood samples using the GUI interface.
2. The system applies various image processing techniques to enhance and segment the antigens from the background.
3. The segmented antigens are analyzed to determine the blood group based on their presence or absence.
4. The results are displayed to the user through the GUI interface.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`: For building the graphical user interface.
- `OpenCV`: For image processing and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations on arrays.
- `matplotlib`: For generating histograms and visualization.
- `Pillow` :Image processing library
